  // each 256-element slice is equal to the first element of the next
  // slice, and keeping those in there this would create small
  // discontinuities in the color wheel. So the last element of each
  // slice is dropped...we regard only elements 0-254, with item 255
  // being picked up as element 0 of the next slice. Like this:
  // Red to not-quite-pure-yellow is:        255,   0, 0 to 255, 254,   0
  // Pure yellow to not-quite-pure-green is: 255, 255, 0 to   1, 255,   0

  @brief   Adjust output brightness. Does not immediately affect what's

  @param   b  Brightness setting, 0=minimum (off), 255=brightest.
  @note    This was intended for one-time use in one's setup() function,
           not as an animation effect in itself. Because of the way this
           library "pre-multiplies" LED colors in RAM, changing the
           brightness is often a "lossy" operation -- what you write to
           pixels isn't necessary the same as what you'll read back.
           Repeated brightness changes using this function exacerbate the
           problem. Smart programs therefore treat the strip as a
           write-only resource, maintaining their own state to render each
           frame of an animation, not relying on read-modify-write.
