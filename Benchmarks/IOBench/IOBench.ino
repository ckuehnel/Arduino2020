/*  IOBench - a simple benchmark for Arduinos and compatibles.
 *  Written by Gareth Halfacree <freelance@halfacree.co.uk>
 *  
 *  Principle: perform digitalRead and digitalWrite operations
 *  to measure the relative performance of Arduino MCUs and
 *  compatible devices.
 *  
 *  The read benchmark begins by measuring the time, in
 *  microseconds, it takes to complete a large loop.
 *  The loop is then repeated with a digitalRead operation,
 *  and the elapsed time in microseconds minus the time taken
 *  by the incrementing of the variable is printed to the
 *  serial port. The benchmark does not require anything to be
 *  connected to Pin 8.
 *  
 *  The write benchmark is split into two sections: soft and hard.
 *  The soft write benchmark requires no extra hardware, and
 *  works the same way as the read benchmark; the hard write
 *  benchmark loops forever and requires a frequency counter or
 *  oscilloscope connected to Pin 7 to measure the performance.
 *  The hard benchmark performs two digitalWrites, one high
 *  and one low, to toggle the pin; this will give a different
 *  result than the single-write soft benchmark. When comparing
 *  boards, always compare soft-to-soft and hard-to-hard; never
 *  compare soft-to-hard or vice-versa.
 *  
 *  NOTE: IOBench is not about getting the best performance out
 *  of a given microcontroller; there are much more efficient
 *  ways to read and write than digitalRead and digitalWrite.
 *  It simply offers a way to quickly compare the relative
 *  performance of different microcontrollers when using the two
 *  most common methods of controlling pins.
